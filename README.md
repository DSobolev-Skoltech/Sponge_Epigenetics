### - ChiP-seq data:
Deep sequencing **(100 bp paired-end)** of the **adult libraries** – **two biological replicates** for **H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K36me3, H3K27me3, RNAPII, input DNA** and **no biological replicates** for **H3K27ac and total histone H3** – was performed by the Macrogen Oceania NGS Unit on **Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument** (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States). 

Deep sequencing **(40 bp paired-end)** of the **larva libraries** – **no biological replicates** for **H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K27me3, H3K27ac, RNAPII, input DNA** – was performed by the Central Analytical Research facility (CARF), Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, on **Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument** (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States).
### - ATAC-seq data:
The **dataset** comprises a comprehensive DNA accessibility profile of the Demosponge species _Amphimedon queenslandica_ through eight developmental stages, obtained using ATAC-seq. The dataset includes **40,218 consensus peaks**, with **4,751 of them showing differential accessibility** in at least one developmental stage.

Paired-end 76-bp reads for **larva and adult Amphimedon queenslandica (three biological replicates for each stage)** were obtained using a **150 cycle NextSeq 500/550 high output reagent kit v2**. Raw data isn’t available, but **preprocessed data contain ATAC-seq peaks**.
### - RNA-seq data:
Raw RNA-seq [data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRP044247) for **adult** and **larva** _Amphimedon queenslandica_ (Illumina HiSeq 2000, PolyA selected, **paired-end**). Additionally, complementary RNA-seq [data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE54364) of **_Amphimedon queenslandica_ larvae** can be used for **gene expression analysis** (Illumina HiSeq 2000, **single-end**).
